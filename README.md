# ReverseStringProject

Welcome to the Reverse Project!

This program will take any string you enter and reverse it. For our purposes, a 'string' can be anything you want, except for '-1'.

When you first open the program, you will be prompted to enter any word(s), character(s), or number(s) (except for -1) you want to be reversed.
Note that entering '-1' (without the quotation marks) will exit the program. This is why you cannot enter '-1' unless you want to exit the program.

Note that you can enter as many spaces, special characters, words, numbers (except -1), or (for the most part) any other symbols as you want.
Negative values, such as '-2' will be reversed as '2-' whereas positive values will be reversed as you would expect. '345' will be come '543'.

You can enter 'Hello' and the program will output 'olleH'. You can enter '!23 675h' and the program will output 'h576 32!'.

The program will prompt you again to enter a string. If you enter another string, it will reverse it. Then, you will once again be prompted to enter a string.
This keeps occuring until you input '-1' to exit the program. Once '-1' is entered, the program will say 'Exit successful.' and the program will stop running.
